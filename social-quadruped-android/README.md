# Social Quadruped Android App
### Fall 2015

An Android application created using Android Studio and Java that enabled the wireless issuing of commands to the Social Quadruped Robot via a Bluetooth Connection. Use of buttons to issue commands proved easier than manually entering them into a traditional bluetooth command line. Buttons and splash screen were designed using Photoshop.
